 [ ] On each board click, the entire board is loaded, processed then saved again,
     which is not so good for single-board concurrency (a single player sending
     an HTTP click message while the previous is being processed).  Doing
     something more granular would place some stress in the persistance store, as
     on each click, more requests would be sent to it; and the cleanup process
     could be heavier.

 [ ] Using cookies for storing the board id may be troublesome for native apps,
     as they need to parse the cookie headers.

 [ ] To generate unique sessions, we use https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid,
     specifically uuid/v4. Need to check if this is good enough.

 [ ] Board.ts: the check for _cellStates and _visibleMatrix is not 100%
     accurate, and may lead to confusions.  There should be static factory
     methods for each scenario (create a new board and instantiate a board from
     JSON).

 [ ] Board initialization (Board.constructor): could be smarter (initialize the
     board as empty, place some random bombs).

 [ ] CORS is allowed without restrictions. This might need review after initial
     clients are developed.
