 [ ] On each board click, the entire board is loaded, processed then saved again,
     which is not so good for single-board concurrency (a single player sending
     an HTTP click message while the previous is being processed).  Doing
     something more granular would place some stress in the persistance store, as
     on each click, more requests would be sent to it; and the cleanup process
     could be heavier.
